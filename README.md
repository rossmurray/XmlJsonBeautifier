# XmlJsonBeautifier
Simple C# program for windows that beautifies any json or xml in your clipboard

If this program finds any xml or json in your clipboard, it will beautify (format / indent) it, and replace the contents of your clipboard with the new text.

Solution was made in Visual Studio 2013.
Depends on Json.NET, out of laziness.
