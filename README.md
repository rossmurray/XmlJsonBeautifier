# XmlJsonBeautifier
Simple C# program for windows that beautifies any json or xml in your clipboard

If this program finds any xml or json in your clipboard, it will beautify (format / indent) it, and replace the contents of your clipboard with the new text.

If it didn't find that your clipboard contents were json or xml, but it finds styled text copied from say, a webpage or Word, it will remove the style on the text.

Solution was made in Visual Studio 2013.
Depends on Json.NET, out of laziness.
